# expedia-interview-challenge
Programming assessment I did for Expedia.
This chunk of code was written in Intellij IDEA. In order to properly run it and the tests it contains you'll need to have the following:
* lombok plugin for Intellij Idea
* Gradle 4.9+ 
* Java 8+

The implementation itself leverages the following libraries and interfaces:
* lombok
* apache commons math
* gson

To whom it may concern. The requirements of the implementation that were stated in the email that I got were somewhat open ended, so I hope it's not an issue that I made a resource model for the deserialized json, and use that to represent the json by passing it to the methods that sort the data.
